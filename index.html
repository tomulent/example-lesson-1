  <h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h1>
    <p>The Youth Empowerment Institute (YEI) is an ongoing project of the Global Information Internship Program (GIIP) and it aims to provide high school students, participating in Watsonville TEC's youth technology programs, with information and resources on how to pursue a college education particularly in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). In YEI we teach about designing smart phone apps to expand their horizons and whet their appetite for what types of classes college has to offer. Additionally, social justice is central to everything we do at GIIP so that these youth come to understand how they fit in to the larger contexts of community and world. It is our belief that encouraging this way of thinking will produce a more driven, socially conscious college going culture among primarily first generation Latino-American youth.</p>
  
    <p>YEI aims to treat Watsonville's problems of education attainment in a holistic manner. First, by educating students on the myriad of grants, loans, and scholarships available to them, students will fully realize the feasibility of attending college. Second, our staff will use their personal and professional experience to guide students through the process of writing a knock-down college admissions essay. Third, by focusing our curriculum on IT, specifically creating mobile phone apps, students will appreciate the vast amount of resources and institutional knowledge that will be available to them in college. Fourth, the overarching theme of the camp (in line with all GIIP initiatives) is social entrepreneurship. Students will develop a keen sense of how their actions shape the world around them. The theme of social enterprise and community will help students to become more integrated members of the Watsonville community, urging them to become transformative actors. We at GIIP believe that focusing on community issues helps counteract the material impulse to view college as a "ticket out" of one's impoverished hometown. And finally, if nothing else, we are attempting to establish a college going culture among these students. Only 11% of the adults in Watsonville have graduated college, meaning that students haven't grown up hearing about college and envisioning themselves attending in the future. By walking the halls, eating in the dining halls, and sleeping in the dorms of a top tier University, they will see that college is within reach and if they apply themselves, they can make it.</p>
  
    <p>Finally, the most unique aspect of the program is a long-term, sustainable mentorship relationship that will connect a college student with a high school student during the one-week camp and beyond: part of the program entails keeping in contact with and bringing the high school students back up on campus for 'check-ins' and further bonding activities. Its intended function is to promote and sustain a college- going culture within the Watsonville community that especially supports those who wish to purse STEM careers and because these high school students have participated in many technology skill-building programs through the intensive courses provided by Watsonville TEC, it is essential to support these students in attaining access to higher education.</p>

 <div>
  <h1 id="need-statement">Statement of Need</h1>
   <p>Despite Watsonville's proximity to both Silicon Valley as well as several major research universities, education levels, along with access to basic technologies and digital information, are shockingly low. According to the 2010 census, Watsonville, CA is a city wherein 81% of its residents identify as Hispanic, 19.2% of its residents live below the poverty line, 42% are foreign-born, and 32% are below the age of 18. Among adults 25 and older, only 52.5% hold a high school diploma or GED and a 10.2% have obtained bachelor's degrees. In comparison, the California averages for those demographics are 80.5% and 29.7% respectively.</p>
  
    <p>Research demonstrates that the disparities in educational achievement and lack of access to technology go hand and hand. Even the brightest STEM students in the Watsonville area lack adequate mentorship and support through the college application process.</p>
  
    <p>YEI continues the work of our partner, Watsonville TEC, which trains students in gaming and computer science from 5th grade to Sophomore year. YEI makes sure that the best and brightest STEM students continue to develop their technology training beyond Sophomore year of high-school and receive support through the college and financial application process. YEI's week long camp on the campus of UCSC fills a gap in making sure these talented students, including several regional and national NCWIT champions, have the experience of a college campus and their first experience at using their knowledge to support themselves and their community. During the camp, students will use the knowledge they gained during college and financial application workshops and technical training to develop a mobile application to showcase to their families and peers.</p>

 <!--/Goals-->
 
 <div>
  <h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
  
 <p> Students will be introduced to the myriad forms that college life takes: clubs, student organizations, and various resources will reassure students that they will be part of a community wherever they go. The goal of this objective is to familiarize each student with the college going culture including Latino and minority student retention organizations, student cultural groups, student technology and innovation clubs, and other parts of the college experience to enhance their perception of what college can do for them. They will not merely read and anticipate a college life, but experience the college campus and partake in undergraduate activities, enhancing the reality of college.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Providing information and resources to guide them through the college admissions and financial aid process will greatly alleviate the overwhelming feeling of confusion and anxiety that both students and parents feel about the costs and expectations of college. By bringing parents to college to eat in the dorms and speak with a college counselor, as well as covering DREAM Act and AB540 issues, will help the entire family feel supported in the college admittance process. Also, with GIIP mentorship, students will get one-on-one support through the college application early enough for YEI students to understand what they need to do to strengthen their applications. GIIPers will also help support and follow up with all students, especially students who may have to navigate college admittance without much family support. Enabling these high school students to experience a slice of college life (staying in the dorms, eating at the dining hall, connecting with student organizations) will crystallize the idea that college is reachable and excelling in it is feasible. Our goal is to ensure that students have a solid grasp of the tools, which they will need to get accepted to college and secure the funds to pay for it.</p>
 
 <p>The YEI website will serve both parents and students. Students will be drawn in by the feeling that it was created specifically for them (because it was) and this will compel them to return to it for college advice. Every bit of information covered during camp will be available on the website for them to reference. It will also act as a forum for students submit questions to their mentors and to answer each other's questions using comment sections. Parents will appreciate the simple layout, bilingual capability, and a special section explaining how to help their children in their college endeavor. Our goal is to foster collaboration between students, mentors, and parents in an informative, personal, advertisement-free environment.</p>
 
 <p>Sustained contact between YEI mentors and student mentees is crucial to success. Through use of technology and personal interaction, students will be up to date on all deadlines and have an open line with their mentors to ask questions and seek support from people they know care and have stood where they stand now. Our goal is to provide students with ongoing, personalized resources and to make them aware that our help will not terminate at the camp's conclusion.</p>
 
 
 <p>Our guiding principle at the Global Information Internship Program is that technology can bring any segment of society, no matter how underrepresented, into the forefront of social justice and civic participation. Students will exit the program with a critical understanding of themselves as social actors and community leaders. Our focus on mobile apps will show them how to bring an equal voice to their community and use technology as a democratizing tool. The goal of this objective is to instill self autonomy within the students' mind frame. Releasing that they themselves can become large actors in their communities, enabling them with the confidence and awareness to move toward a socially productive future.</p>
 
 <p>This year's summer cohort will be exposed to technology which enables them to develop their very own mobile application. In addition, the the foundation of their created mobile application will be centered around the foundations of social enterprise, teaching them the basics of innovation and project design around community problems they see in their community. Our goal is to by the end of camp to have several student designed mobile applications that can be downloaded and used by the students and shown to friends. We will also encourage and set up interested YEI students with plans and support to continue to develop and work on their applications for submission to youth technology competitions and grants in the year that follows.</p>
 
 <p>YEI is designed not only to expose underrepresented youth to exciting new IT frontiers, but to give them the tools to get to college. Our college workshops will help them select the right school for them and the financial aid workshop will ensure they can secure they can secure the funds necessary to make their goals possible.</p>
 
 <a href="#objectives">Back To Top</a>

 <!--/Objectives-->
 
 <div>
 <h1 id="methodology">Methodology</h1>
 
 		<p>In early May, with the support of our partner, Watsonville TEC, we will recruit students from Pajaro Valley high schools who are interested in technology and are primarily Latino youth. The first and most important aspect of our youth outreach program is to hold an orientation meeting to lay out our vision and goals to interested students and parents. Given that we have limited space, the orientation will be a way for us to explain our plans for familial and GIIP support to ensure students bright futures. We will also give out applications to help us select students who are interested in technology and STEM careers, who seem likely to need more support to go to college. We will explain the camp, the support network, and what is expected of parents and students to make the camp and college admittance process a success. We hope that the orientation will also be a way to explain resources to the community and benefit more families than just those that end up participating in the camp.</p>
 
 		<p>Parent involvement is of paramount importance to success of the program, so we will involve them as much as possible. During the orientation, parents will be assessed for their tech literacy, and given information on how to attend adult tech open labs run by PACT, another GIIP initiative. They will be made aware that the YEI staff as well as Watsonville TEC are available to them as a resource.
 		Next, we will follow up with admitted students in June and give them the itinerary and schedule of the camp. In early June and July, we will nail down all the logistics for housing, professional presentations, student groups, and club activities. We will also finalize our Mobile Application workshops, simplifying from GIIP's own Mobile Apps Lab taught to university students. We will also follow up with YEI students and make sure they and their families are ready for the camp in early August.</p>
 
 		<p>The itinerary for the YEI camp in early August is below. During the camp, half of the workshops each day will be on college readiness and the other on technology training in Mobile Apps. We focus on Mobile Applications as a nexus for social networking, technology training and programming understanding, and the ability to share a finished product with friends and family. The hope is that because Mobile Apps will be new to all the students and something new as a technological product, it will truly offer them an opportunity to see how they could follow a STEM career path. We will use ApplicationCraft and Tropo SMS Mobile application creators and self-designed templates to teach students the basic of how to design mobile applications and where to find programming resources or learn programming online. The best part is that we will be using web-based open software so that students
 		will need nothing more than an Internet connection to continue their work.Our emphasis on using mobile applications to tackle community problems (like registering to vote, translation services, and crowd- sourcing community problems) will leave students appreciative of the positive potential for technology careers and a college education for their community.</p>
 
 		<p>In addition to the technology labs, we will be holding workshops on college attainment and financial aid. It's no secret that high school counselors are overworked and often lack the necessary knowledge to guide students through applying for aid. The college workshops will take students through the college selection and application process, and the comprehensive financial aid workshop will explain the nature of paying for college and how to secure those funds. Students will be assisted in filling out the Free Application for Financial Student Aid, and briefed on the myriad complications that arise after filing. Copies of the multimedia presentations and supplemental information will all be available on the YEI website.</p>
 
 		<p>The YEI website has been designed to act as a personalized resource for students and parents. Many Watsonville parents have limited English and technology skills and the website takes this into consideration by implementing simplified design and Spanish translation. Parents can use the site to educate themselves on the college application and financial aid process. Students will use the site in the same way but also as a way to interact with the staff. Comments are enabled on each page and students are encouraged to utilize the site's forum feature to discuss issues, answer each other's questions, and query the staff directly</p>

 <div>
 <h1 id="assessment-and-evaluation">Assessment and Evaluation</h1>
 
 		<p>YEI fully intends to remain a yearly occurrence and critical to our mission is the ability to evaluate the efficacy of our program so that we may fine tune it as the years go by. To achieve this we have several systems in place. First, during parent orientation we will gather contact information and ask that parents inform us if they move. This way if the students lose contact with us, we may still receive status updates from parents. Second, the density of media used by students is unprecedented and we intend to utilize this by gathering phone numbers, email addresses (if they don't have one we will make one), Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, LinkedIn or any other media students may use. Ideally snooping will not be necessary due to the mentorship aspect of the program.</p>
 
 		<p>The sustainable mentorship aspect of our program will offer us an organic method for evaluating the success of YEI. The mentor/mentee relationship will provide us with easy access for follow up come graduation time and college enrollment as students will see interacting with their mentors as a valuable resource rather than an obligation. Check up sessions will be conducted leading up to and following college application deadlines and FAFSA deadlines as well as sessions towards the end of the school year. At this time we will gather data on where students have been accepted, where they plan to attend, and what sort of financial aid they will be receiving. During summer vacation we will update contact information including address and college email address.</p>
 
 		<p>Effectiveness of the program will be reflected across several dimensions. First, upon completion of the program, students will complete a detailed evaluation asking them how they felt the camp has benefited them, what they learned, what they want more/less of, how much more they feel they are prepared for getting into college, etc. This exit polling will help us with the next year's tailoring process. Second, by monitoring traffic on the YEI website we can get an idea of whether or not they are using
 		it as a reference source. Comments and discussion on the site will also help us gauge students' level of involvement. Finally, data collected during check ups and later check ins will be compared to local, state, and national statistics to ascertain whether or not these students are performing above expectations.</p>
